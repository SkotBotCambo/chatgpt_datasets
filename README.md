# ChatGPT Datasets
This repository is for collecting and documenting all datasets have aided the development of ChatGPT to 
offer a level of transparency that is currently, and ironically, unavailable from Open AI directly.

These datasets include training sets, evaluation sets and datasets that may be good benchmarks for ChatGPT, but we can't say for sure
that they were or were not used in development.
